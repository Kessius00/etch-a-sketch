# etch-a-sketch 

The goal was to create a screen for a person to make pixelart on, or to just go wild with a random color or random shade. Or even make the shade incrementally darken based on how many times you have drawn over the pixel.

# Lessons Learned 💭
I used button:active for the fist time and how to get a color from input type color, also how to use input type range. I also used CSS grid for the first time! 

# Optimization ✅
- Maybe add more css for more beauty
- Add more options on how to draw

# Tech Used 💻
