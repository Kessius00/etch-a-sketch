# etch-a-sketch
The goal was to create a screen for a person to make pixelart on, or to just go wild with a random color or random shade. Or even make the shade incrementally darken based on how many times you have drawn over the pixel!

# Lessons Learned
I used button:active for the fist time and how to get a color from input type color, also how to use input type range. I also used CSS grid for the first time!
